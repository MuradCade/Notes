- User research

- Information Architecture
  
  what is information Architecture is?
  
  information architecture is organizing and deciding what content to include or not include in your website.
  
  this includes all the information in your website and it helps the audience how navigate and achieve tasks.
  
  even if not the most exciting it definitely one of the most important part of ux design, because carefully designed information architecture can determine if the user leave or stay with in the few seconds of visiting your website.
  
  Structure of your website should include the following steps:-
  
  - Step1: Define User Goals
    
    this will help us figure out our top pages such as home page then you will link out all other main pages.
    
    to figure out what other pages are , you need to figure out what is the main action you want user todo while they are on your site/website.
    
    ****
    
    Example: -
    
    the main user goals of Ecommerce website maybe search for clothes , added to your cart and find near by store to shop at.
    
    ****
    
    so the top pages may be clothing category , cart and location.
    
    we can also look at information architecture like your house , what is the main layout of all the rooms in your house, a few rooms you need is kitchen to cook on , a bedroom to sleep in , bathroom to do human stuff. :).
    
    so those should be included in top navigation if your house was website.
    
    one thing to know the home page shouldn't be too long trying to explain everything on the whole site , it should give clear sense of the main purpose and the type of things that you can find. if you already have website one way to do this is do content audit , list out all pages with the number of visit , the urls and type of content.
    
    This can help you see what pages users are visiting the most you might want to draw more attention to it  
    
    
  
  - Step2: Group Content
    
    think about what you want your users to do on each page, just like you organize item in your house based on how likely you are to use those thing.
    
    in Ecommerce example you will put product page under clothes, the checkout flow under shopping cart and the map stores under locations.
    
    | product | cart     | location      |
    | ------- |:-------- | ------------- |
    | clothes | checkout | find location |
    | shoes   | payment  | map           |
    
  
  - Step3: Sort By Usefulness
    
    we want to make sure the content user see is relevant depending what page they are on.
    
    so our home example if put every single item in the kitchen on the counter it will be way over whelming to find exactly what we need when wee need it this is called cognitive overload, so instead we need to filter/sort our information by their usefulness, in order to do that we will use something called drop down menu , for Ecommerce site you generally group concepts together in drop downs for examples:-
    
    | Clothes | Accessories |
    | ------- | ----------- |
    | jackets | hats        |
    | pants   | boots       |
    | t-shirt | sunglasses  |
  
  - Step4: Getting into details
    
    it defines how people will be using your website.
    
    its important to assume people will not always reaching your website from the home page they might find your website through google search , etc.
    
    users can come through any of those site pages so its important to orient users where they are just might you can enter your home from different doors,it should be easy to navigate and appealing to use.
    
    example use bread crumb (home/testimonials), it shows where use is and how to navigate back , also you can add to your navigation indicator that helps user to now where he/she is,  and user my use their phone or tablet to use your website so make use that your website is responsive on each device break point.
