MobileApp Explained
----------------------------------------
Let me explain the features of this mobile app designed for university students. This app is a comprehensive academic management tool that helps students organize their tasks, schedule, and grades. Let's break down each feature:

1. Task Management (assignments, projects, exams):
This is the core feature of the app, helping students keep track of all their academic tasks.

a) Enhanced Task Categories:

1. Assignments: These are short-term tasks. For example, a student might add "Write essay for English 101" due in 5 days.
2. Projects: Longer-term tasks. For instance, "Semester-long research project for Biology" that spans 3 months.
3. Exams: Time-bound events. Example: "Midterm exam for Calculus II" scheduled for a specific date and time.


b) Detailed Task Information:

1. Due date and time: Students can set "May 15, 2023, 11:59 PM" for their assignment deadline.
2. Course association: Tasks can be linked to specific courses, like "CHEM 202" or "HIST 101".
3. Priority level: Students can mark tasks as high, medium, or low priority.
4. Estimated time to complete: A student might estimate "4 hours" for completing a problem set.
5. Subtasks: For a project, a student could break it down into subtasks like "Research", "Outline", "First Draft", "Final Draft".


c) Sorting and Filtering:

1. Students can sort tasks to see what's due soonest, what's highest priority, or view all tasks for a specific course.
2. They can filter to see only assignments, only upcoming exams, or only ongoing projects.


d) Reminders and Notifications:

1. The app can send a reminder "Your Chemistry lab report is due in 2 days" based on the student's preferences.
2. Push notifications might alert "Exam in Advanced Statistics tomorrow at 9 AM".


e) Progress Tracking:

1. Students can mark tasks as "Not Started", "In Progress", or "Completed".
2. For projects with subtasks, the app might show "Research Paper: 60% complete" based on completed subtasks.



2. Class Schedule:
This feature helps students keep track of their weekly class timetable. For example:

1. Monday: 9 AM - 11 AM: Introduction to Psychology
2. Tuesday: 2 PM - 4 PM: Organic Chemistry Lab
3. Wednesday: 10 AM - 12 PM: World History Lecture



3. Simple Grade Tracker:
Students can input their grades for different assignments and exams. For instance:

1. Math 101: Homework 1 (90%), Quiz 1 (85%), Midterm (88%)
2. The app might show a current course average based on these inputs.



4. Basic Reminders:
Apart from task-specific reminders, students can set general reminders like:

1. "Buy textbook for Economics class"
2. "Sign up for next semester's classes"
3. "Meet with academic advisor next week"
